Hi, I am a Dutch Master's student in the department of Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity graduating in Juli 2020,
Currently I am doing an internship at Utrecht University where I am building a phosphorylation motif detection database with [web GUI](https://bms-370-215.science.uu.nl/database/).

I have a Bachelors degree in Biomedical research, where I focussed on biotechnology and bioinformatics.
My interest lie in software development, back-end and front-end programming. The [Projects section](#projects) below shows some of my spare time programming projects.

Besides programming, I also like to do sports (mostly climbing), to be in nature, to cook, and keeping plants.
